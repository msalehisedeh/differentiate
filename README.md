# Welcome to Differentiate Objects!

Have you ever needed to compare two JSON objects and make a determination on what is changed deep in the object hierarchy and be able to clearly 
see what is changed on either objects on the fly while they change?
Have you ever wished for ability to merge the two JSON objects as well? Have you looked for something that is visually appealing as well?
Would you like to know how it can be done? Would you like to have it done without writing code for it? Take a look at the demo and enjoy the ride.

Differentiate is an Angular based code and will interpret changes deep in JSON hierarchy through visual representation of changes on both sides. 
"+" / "-" characters on left-hand side as well as diverging line curves over a node of an object view represent adding/removing of an attribute or a node.
"~" characters on left-hand side of a node represent change of value between two name/value pairs.

**I appreciate comments and requests.** please go to provided link and make your comments.
